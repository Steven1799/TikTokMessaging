In this assignment, I will design and develop an IM system implementing a set of specific APIs using Golang. I will only develop the backend side of the system, focusing on core message features without the front-end part and the account/authentication part.

// stuff I did
1) Set up and configure a datastore using Redis
2) Edit docker-compose.yml to add a Redis server
3)Setup Redis client in the rpc-server
4) Implement handlers in rpc-server
5) Replacing areyoulucky() with a logic that works (writing and reading messages from Redis)
